            The Government Arts College, Thanthonimalai, Karur enjoys the fame
            of being the only institution in the whole district to show the
            longest academic history and public service. Established in 1966, it
            has worked its way ahead of other colleges in the matter of offering
            higher education of remarkable quality and largely to middle and
            lower income groups. The repute of this town as a textile industrial
            centre is further enhanced by the performance record of the
            Government Arts College Karur as it has never once in the recent
            years lacked a gold medalist. This college is affiliated to
            Bharathidasan University, Tiruchirappalli.
